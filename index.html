    <p>The history of photography began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles: camera
        obscura image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light.
        There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive
        materials prior to the 18th century (with the arguable exception of a possibly photographic process used to
        create the mysterious shroud of Turin).

        Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he
        apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably
        documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did
        produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.

        In the mid-1820s, Nicéphore Niépce first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least
        eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very
        crude. Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly
        announced and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in
        the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The details were introduced to the world in 1839, a
        date generally accepted as the birth year of
        practical photography.[2][3] The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the
        paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot and demonstrated in
        1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype reached Talbot. Subsequent innovations made photography easier and
        more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually
        to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient. Since the
        1850s, the collodion process with its glass-based photographic plates combined the high quality known from the
        Daguerreotype with the multiple print options known from the calotype and was commonly used for decades. Roll
        films popularized casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs
